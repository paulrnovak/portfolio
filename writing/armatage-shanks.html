              I was in London for the past few days, and while using the bathroom and I noticed this funky and uniquely British brand name on the urinal — "Armitage Shanks”. No idea, but it means or the history, but I love the scripty type and it’s impossible to say without an English twinge in your voice.

              I instantly thought about the Green Day song, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/59sqMNnhzYLyijAFRv7gEw?si=30d24f4bb8c54bcb" target="_blank" class="link underline commit">track 01 off of Insomniac</a> — a top 3 record from them in my opinion. So then I weirdly snapped a photo of a urinal. Luckily, I was the only one in the loo.

              Got me curious, did they name this song after a British toilet company? The coincidence would be crazy, but theirs is spelled with an i instead of an e… then I did a whole bunch of highly specific Green Day related internet searches and yes, Billie Joe confirmed in a tweet from 2011. Also stumbled on some old <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/greenday/comments/u0do2h/so_billie_joe_actually_did_confirm_the/" target="_blank" class="link commit underline">old show footage</a> that confirms this even further. Also glad to know I’m not the only one searching for these answers.

              Presumably, this discovery happened during this recording session:

            <p>
              I also found someone proclaiming that they chose the spelling to <a href="https://www.songfacts.com/facts/green-day/armatage-shanks" target="_blank" class="commit link underline">avoid copyright issues</a>, but I have no other info or source to back this up.

              Small sidebar, during the 1994 MTV Music Awards, Green Day was supposed to play their hit song <a href="https://youtu.be/NUTGr5t3MoY?si=Hv5z5uzK-8zBvGvN" target="_blank" class="commit link underline">Basket Case</a> from their breakout album Dookie. Instead of doing that... they came out and played Armatage Shanks a song that would not be released for over a year. A move I’ve always respected.

              Then, in other strange coincidences, the day after we returned from England, I was looking at Apple Maps after learning about an extremely <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/08/28/us/video/minnesota-vigils-ldndigvid" target="_blank" class="commit link underline">sad and unfortunate event</a> in my city and noticed a park nearby with the name Armitage (with an a)…
            </p>
            <img src="../img/writing/armatage-shanks/maps.png" alt="A screenshot of Apple Maps showing Armitage Park in Minneapolis, MN." class="w-100"/>
            <p>
              I was aware of this part of the city, but never knew the name of the neighborhood. I ended up reading all about the woman behind the name of the neighborhood and the school there, <a href="https://armatage.org/about/history/" target="_blank" class="commit link underline">Maude D. Armatage</a>. She was an incredible woman who did a lot of good for the people and children of Minneapolis, and is one of the people to thank for our tremendous parks system.
            </p>
            <p>
              Then maybe because I was looking for it at this point, but in the evening that same night, I was listening to <a href="https://www.dolloppodcast.com" target="_blank" class="commit link underline">The Dollop</a> while doing the dishes (as one does), and Armitage popped up once more. I had part two of the Bo Gritz episodes on, and the deputy assistant secretary of defense for East Asia and Pacific affairs under Regan, <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Armitage_(government_official)" target="_blank" class="commit link underline">Richard Armitage</a>, gets mentioned. I’ve never heard of this guy before, turns out he's a real piece of garbage and likely responsible for the Iran-Contra. But there’s that name again…
            </p>
            <p>
              Continuing some searching, the word/name Armitage is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armitage_(computing)" target="_blank" class="commit link underline">all</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armitage" target="_blank" class="commit link underline">over</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armitage_III" target="_blank" class="commit link underline">the</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Armitage_(actor)" target="_blank" class="commit link underline">place</a> and fairly common, but I was so intrigued for a small amount of time how this name kept appearing in my life. Toilets, one of your favorite songs, a neighborhood about 15 minutes from your house, and a podcast episode can all collide in unrelated ways within the span of a few days.

# My New Simple Portfolio

An attempt to simplify and move my site away from other places and services and self host it here on GitHub using Pages. Also wanting to relearn how it feels to write a whole and site maintain the code by hand while teaching myself some new things as well.

Gonna also attempt to create a real working blog / writing section within here.

CSS will be powered by my old friend Tachyons.
